# pisa_survey_analysis

This project is a submission for the Data Visualizations’ unit of Udacty’s Nanodegree program: “Data Analysis”. I worked on the PISA dataset which is mainly about a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. As the dataset size is exceeding 2 GB, you can access it from here.


For this investigation, I wanted to check some variables that influence students’ academic performance in the PISA test. The focus of my analysis was on these variables: country, is_oecd, gender, belong at school, feel happy at school, and computers’ availability at schools.


# Exploratory data analysis findings

1. China-Shanghai has the most students who have the best scores.
2. Most students score between 400 and 600 out of 1000. The mean for their scores is around 500. 
3. Jordan has the most students scoring less than the mean of all math scores.
4. There is a higher probability for OECD students to achieve better scores than the Non-OECD countries.
5. Females’ and males’ scores are not so different from each other.


# Explanatory data analysis findings

Gender does not have any correlation with academic performance. Both genders had good scores in different countries. Some countries had the males scoring better, others had females, but overall the difference is not so big to judge any correlation between both variables. On the other hand, the visualizations showed that scores are different across different countries. Some had more students scoring higher than mean, higher than the other countries. Therefore, I think that the educational system of each country is affecting students’ scores, but further investigation needs to be done to prove this point. Now, we can say that being a student in some countries, can help you achieve better grades. Moreover, I spotted that if the school is going digital, supporting computers and technology at it, this would help students achieve higher scores. Additionally, I found that students from OECD countries achieve higher scores than Non-OECD ones. Finally, I observed that there is a correlation between students’ feelings at schools and academic performance. If students are feeling happy and connected to the school, this would help them towards better scores.
